                ffective studying requires your mind to be actively engaged in
                the material. Simply reading and re-reading texts or notes is
                not actively engaging in the material. Reading and even
                re-reading your notes or your texts is important, but it’s not
                the ideal way to study. Think of reading as an important part of
                pre-studying, but learning information requires actively
                engaging in the material (Edwards, 2014). Active engagement is
                the process of constructing meaning from text that involves
                making connections to lectures, forming examples, and regulating
                your own learning (Davis, 2007). Active studying does not mean
                highlighting or underlining text, re-reading, or rote
                memorization. Though these activities may help to keep you
                engaged in the task, they are not considered active studying
                techniques and are weakly related to improved learning
                (Mackenzie, 1994). Purely re-reading your notes is NOT studying.
                It is simply re-reading your notes. Only ‘doing’ the readings
                for class is not studying. It is simply doing the reading for
                class. Re-reading leads to quick forgetting. Ideas for active
                studying include: Create a study guide by topic. Formulate
                questions and problems and write complete answers. Become a
                teacher. Say the information aloud in your own words as if you
                are the instructor and teaching the concepts to a class. Derive
                examples that relate to your own experiences. Create concept
                maps or diagrams that explain the material. Develop symbols that
                represent concepts. For non-technical classes (e.g., English,
                History, Psychology), figure out the big ideas so you can
                explain, contrast, and re-evaluate them. For technical classes,
                work the problems and explain the steps and why they work. Study
                in terms of question, evidence, and conclusion. What is the
                question posed by the instructor/author? What is the evidence
                that they present? What is the conclusion? Create your own quiz.
                Organization and planning will help you to actively study for
                your courses. When studying for a test, organize your materials
                first and then begin your active reviewing by topic (Newport,
                2007). Often professors provide subtopics on the syllabi. Use
                them as a guide to help organize your materials. For example,
                gather all of the materials for one topic (e.g., PowerPoint
                notes, text book notes, articles, homework, etc.) and put them
                together in a pile. Label each pile with the topic and study by
                topics.

                Studying is not just reading or rereading Students almost always
                equate rereading with studying or learning and that is often
                because they have learned no other strategies. Rereading,
                however, only provides students with basic working knowledge or
                comprehension of the material read. In order to change that new
                knowledge from short term to long term memory, you must interact
                with, not just reread it. Set up reading for interaction Setting
                the reading material up in a format for interacting is critical.
                Whether students wish to take notes, make marginal comments,
                record examples, highlight important information or compare the
                course text to the lecture notes from class, it is imperative to
                change the required text into a format that will allow
                interactivity. This may mean printing out material, reformatting
                to an accessible format, or creating a separate note area for
                documenting thoughts while reading. Interacting means
                summarizing, organizing, categorizing, analyzing, synthesizing,
                collecting images and creating study guides.

                now where you study best. The silence of a library may not be
                the best place for you. Know where you study best. The silence
                of a library may not be the best place for you. Though you might
                earn brownie points with your parents when you go to the library
                to study for 8 hours, this might not be the best decision if you
                don’t work well in quiet places. It’s important to consider what
                noise environment works best for you. You might find that you
                concentrate better with some background noise. Some people find
                that listening to classical music while studying helps them
                concentrate, while others find this highly distracting. The
                point is that the silence of the library may be just as
                distracting (or more) than the noise of a gymnasium. Thus, if
                silence is distracting, but you prefer to study in the library,
                try the first or second floors where there is more background
                ‘buzz.’ Keep in mind that active studying is rarely silent as it
                often requires saying the material aloud.

                There are some heroic stories as well of elephants stepping in
                to help humans. It can be to protect them from animals including
                other elephants at times. They have been able to help them when
                natural disasters occur, moving heavy items to get to people and
                to rescue them. Most researchers aren’t surprised by these acts
                at all though. This is because they elephant is well known to
                being intelligent and capable of experiencing the same emotions
                as humans.

                orking and re-working problems is important for technical
                courses (e.g., math, economics). Be able to explain the steps of
                the problems and why they work. In technical courses, it is
                usually more important to work problems than read the text
                (Newport, 2007). In class, write down in detail the practice
                problems demonstrated by the professor. Annotate each step and
                ask questions if you are confused. At the very least, record the
                question and the answer (even if you miss the steps). When
                preparing for tests, put together a large list of problems from
                the course materials and lectures. Work the problems and explain
                the steps and why they work (Carrier, 2003).

                A significant amount of research indicates that multi-tasking
                does not improve efficiency and actually negatively affects
                results (Junco, 2012). In order to study smarter, not harder,
                you will need to eliminate distractions during your study
                sessions. Social media, web browsing, game playing, texting,
                etc. will severely affect the intensity of your study sessions
                if you allow them! Research is clear that multi-tasking (e.g.,
                responding to texts, while studying), increases the amount of
                time needed to learn material and decreases the quality of the
                learning (Junco, 2012). Eliminating the distractions will allow
                you to fully engage during your study sessions. If you don’t
                need your computer for homework, then don’t use it. Use apps to
                help you set limits on the amount of time you can spend at
                certain sites during the day. Turn your phone off. Reward
                intensive studying with a social-media break (but make sure you
                time your break!) See our handout on managing technology for
                more information.
